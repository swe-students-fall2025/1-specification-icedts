## Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders for this project will be the end users, the NYU students whom the app is designed for, so we interviewed several students about their needs and what they would do with such an app. These were some of their responses and takeaways.

### Responses:
1. “I think maybe I could trade like collectibles and stuff... I am pretty confident that some of my friends would love this platform to trade clothes, accessories, etc…”
2. “(I could) purchase used textbook according to subject, or basic houseware in dorm scenarios. It would be easier if I can purchase others used item according to specific major/subject requirements. Potentially, it would save students’ cost on purchasing school materials.”
3. “I’ll sell textbook, the primary use. Selling expensive Chemistry, Economics, or Literature textbooks to a student taking the same class next semester.”
4. “NYU did a swap on 2nd ave and not only me, but my friends, were able to grab items we’ve needed for a long time for free. It upped my quality of life, the clothes, storage, and decorative pieces I got from that.”
5. “For furnitures, clothes and books. Buy things and join a commnity which has opportunities to get more when needed.”
6. “I can trade books because same course share a booklist, and I can trade my furnitures and clothes. For tasks, I think maybe verification system? Because this ensures reliability and safety.”

### Takeaways:
1. Reliability and safety when exchanging items is important to potential users.
2. The top 3 categories of items that students are interested in exchanging are books (especially textbooks), clothes, and furniture.
3. The platform’s main appeal to potential users is being able to save money on expensive items such as textbooks.
4. However, students expressed interest in exchanging a wide variety of items, including collectibles, accessories, houseware, decor, etc.
5. Most students can see themselves and their peers using this platform.
6. Students say the platform could improve their quality of life and provide a community for them.

## Product Vision Statement

This application will serve as an interactive way for verified NYU students to exchange school supplies, living appliances, and used clothing, allowing users to effectively donate their unneeded items while gathering their needs in one virtual space.

## User Requirements

1. As a new user, I want to create an account, so I can sell items through my own personal profile.
2. As a new user, I want to create my own personal account with my NYU ID, so that I do not access anyone else’s information.
3. As a returning user, I want my account to be secure, so that no one can access my profile with the wrong credentials.
4. As a trader, I want to list my items I'm willing to exchange, so that other members can see and propose an offer.
5. As a trader, I want to add a description to an item I’m listing, so that I can provide extra details about it.
6. As a trader, I want to provide an exchange address, so that the item can be exchanged to me securely.
7. As a trader, I want to search for items, so that the products I want will appear for me to propose offers to.
8. As a trader, I want to see a description for a listed item, including how old it is and its condition, so I know the quality of my potential exchange.
9. As a trader, I want to make a wishlist of items that I want, so other users viewing my profile can see if they have any of these items to trade with me.
10. As a trader, I want to list books by their ISBN number, so that it is easier for other students to find it.
11. As a trader, I want to search for books by their ISBN number, so that I can reliably find the book I want.
12. As a trader, I want to be notified when a book that is on my wishlist is listed by another user, so that I can trade for the book quickly.
13. As a trader, I want to message other users about items they’ve listed, so that I can ask for more details about the item.
14. As a trader, I want to safely back out of an exchange so that I can ensure communication in case my situation changes.
15. As a trader, I want to make a review of the other user after participating in an exchange, so I can let others know how my experience was.
16. As a trader, I want to view the reviews on another user’s profile, so I can decide whether or not to trade with the user.
17.  As a trader, I want to see my trade history to see my former trades and the item(s) I got in exchange for my former item(s), so I can keep track of my account.
18. As a trader, I want to block another user from visiting my profile, so that they can no longer message me or request to trade with me.
19. As a trader, I want to scroll the homepage, so I can view recently listed items and items suggested for me.
20. As a trader, I want to filter by type (school supplies/books/clothes/etc) when searching for items, so I can more easily find the item I want.
21. As a trader, I want to sort search results by “recently listed” or “most relevant”, so that I can more easily find the item I want.
22. As a user, I want to view and adjust my account settings including preferences and privacy settings, so I can feel secure and have a comfortable experience with the app.
23. As a user, I want to set and change my profile picture, so I can accurately represent myself on my profile.
